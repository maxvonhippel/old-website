Max von Hippel's Landing Page

I've built an interactive landing page using D3.JS and Github Pages, and you're absolutely welcome to use my code-base as a structure with which to build your own interactive landing page!  Just don't try to take credit for any of my essays, photographs, apps, code, etc., and let me know if you make somethign cool with my code so I can check it out!
