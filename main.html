<center><h1>Hi!  I'm Max.</h1></center>
<p>I'm a UWCCR '15 and BlackHat 2016 Student Scholar from Alaska.  I study pure mathematics and computer science at the University of Arizona Honors College in Tucson, and I'm interested in pure math, logic, data visualization, OpenStreetMaps, GIS, and security.  I also like writing pithy things on the internet, skateboarding, and street and landscape photography with my trusty Fujifilm X-Pro1.  This is my nifty website.</p>
