<br><center>The moderators here, whom I greatly respect, asked for help and so, in the very unlikely event that I’m elected, I’ll try to be helpful and nothing more. And that’s about all I have to say.
<br><br>Alfred, why then should anyone vote for you? They shouldn’t.
<br><br>Alfred, WTF?

<br><center>I can claim to have such an understanding because I have long been involved in most aspects of moderation on this site that are carried out by the community: I am an active reviewer in the close, low quality, reopen and suggested edit queues. I have cast close to 1.5k helpful flags and I am the user with the largest total of up- and downvotes cast of the entire site. I have written 71 meta posts, not a single one of which has a negative vote total at the time of this writing.</center>

<br><center>... you should know that if elected, I will bring the same impartiality and fairness you all have come to expect from me to moderating. I always try to be civil and peaceful and never let the discussion dissolve into insults or jabs. [...] If there are two candidates that would do an equal or better job than me, I urge you to vote for them instead. But if elected, I’ll do my best for the community.</center>
