<br>
My father used to work for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/native-alaskans-study-and-clean-up-a-legacy-of-pollution.html?_r=0">University of Alaska Anchorage</a>, but due to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/us/oil-collapse-drains-alaskas-wide-ranging-education-system.html">Alaska’s economic collapse</a> he recently decided to leave UAA and take a new position at Northern Arizona University. We paid a moving company to take most of our belongings down to Flagstaff, but Dad didn’t believe he could entrust any moving company with his precious Land Rover Defender 90, “Ruby”, so he and I took matters into our own hands and drove Ruby down ourselves. We installed a rooftop tent on Ruby and lived in it for 2 weeks, survived on CLIF bars and Corona, and had a great time. The video above is the story of that adventure, and the post below details the gear used, route taken, and other such gnarly technical details.

	<center><b>Notes On The Route</b></center></div>
<br>
<br>
Dad and I did our best to take the long route. We visited as many parks, hiked as many hikes, spelunked in as many caves, and used as many side-roads as possible.
<br>
<br>
One major obstacle got in our way: I have a brother, and he is 9, and he had a 3 day break from summer camp, and we had to pick him up on time and take care of him during that break. Mom was insistent on this point. We were not to abandon the 9 year old! Luckily, we absolutely, completely managed to pick Sam up on time. Specifically, on the time of 3.5 hours after his camp ended. But as I said in the video, “really, camp doesn’t end until we pick him up!”
<br>
<br>
All that is to say that in the brief portion of the trip between Skagway and
Hidden Valley, Granite Falls, Washington, we drove the fast route. As in, 900+ miles a day, as direct as possible toward our destination. In conclusion: the mysteriously straight leg of our trip over part of Canada and Washington is not a representation of how that leg of the trip really should be done, so in planning your route, you should find something cooler to do in that segment of the journey.

<br>
<br>
<b>Tok</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/zju2z4zadm52qw.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6)
<br>
<br>
The small towns like Tok which lead up to the Canadian border are characterized by what Dad and I called “Everything Shops”: stores where you could peruse every rifle and pistol clip known to man in one isle, then pick out your favorite brand of non-fat organic milk in the next. Stores where things are arranged by size, and so, “items small enough to fit in a purse” get their own display case:

<b>Whitehorse</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/nfucysvaynddng.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6)
<br>
<br>
Whitehorse features awesome hiking, mountain biking, espresso, real food, and charming people. You can park basically wherever you want without getting a ticket. You can restock on supplies at decent outdoor shops. Whitehorse is charming, fun, and full of good food on a route characterized by a lack thereof.
<br>
<br>
<b>Skagway</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/8usenbyzmqurw.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6)
<br>
<br>
Skagway is awesome. The food is great, the people are nice, the town is beatific and well-maintained. And then the ships arrive, and the tourists pile out, and shit hits the fan.
<br>
<br>
Luckily, none of the tourists go more than four blocks from harbor (this is not an exaggeration), so they are relatively easy to avoid. The nearby hikes are stunning and range in difficulty from easy to relatively hard, and perhaps most importantly, the drive in and out of Skagway is the most beautiful stretch of road my father and I have ever witnessed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cle Elum</b>
<br>
<br>
We visited the cabin of family friends in Cle Elum and had a superb time. It’s a relatively remote area characterized by biker dudes, interesting rock formations, and an overabundance of wildlife.
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/auxsahavgoiiq.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6 using Moment wide-angle lens)
<br>
<br>
The weather was superb, and we enjoyed hiking, bouldering, photography, archery, and outdoor grilling and eating.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mount St. Helens</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/mudwt8aphz1cq.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with Fujifilm X-Pro1, using XF 27mm f/2.8 black lens)
<br>
<br>
Mount St. Helens was possibly the best stop of the entire trip. The landscape is so new as to seem alien. Wildflowers grow on everything, and canyons caved out of hundreds of feet of pure silt paint sinews in the mountainside.
<br>
<br>
Trees literally shot like rockets in the initial explosion now rest askew forming radial patterns across the meandering landscape, and birds and other wildlife make use of the strange new earth.
<br>
<br>
<b>Crater Lake National Park</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/4nmwci7vuzlwkq.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6)
<br>
<br>
Crater Lake National Park is stunningly beautiful. It is interesting in terms of weather, in that you drive in in blazingly hot desert and quickly elevate into windy, snow-swept mountains. There are plenty of hikes without other tourists, and the visitor center sells CLIF BARS.
<br>
<br>
<b>Lava Beds National Monument</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/lhjp9zgpip8ww.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with iPhone 6)
<br>
<br>
Lava Beds National Monument was a terrific stop. The nice lady at the front desk told us a particular hike took at least an hour, and after doing it in literally 15 minutes we realized we could probably do a third of the hikes (terranean and subterranean) in the park before heading out and still leave on time - so we did.
<br>
<br>
We enjoyed spelunking, exploring, and generally gallivanting about in the aftermath of the destruction of the inner mechanisms of the earth.
<br>
<br>
<b>Lassen Volcanic National Park</b>
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/stock-photo-deep-blue-168027993.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with Fujifilm X-Pro1, using XF 27mm f/2.8 black lens)
<br>
<br>
Lassen Volcanic National Park is stunning - even when you can barely see it. We pulled up to Bumpass Hell right as the sun began to set, and the view proved spectacular. It is not through any trickery of Photoshop that these images are so clearly imbued with blues and purples and gold.
<br>
<br>
<img class="center fit" src="images/ck76g1dqflutfa.jpg">
<br>
(Photo captured with Fujifilm X-Pro1, using XF 27mm f/2.8 black lens)
<br>
<br>
We were barred from hiking Bumpass Hell because so many moronic tourists had burned themselves on the boiling hot volcanic liquids emanating all around, and so the trail was officially cordoned off. We still managed to hike a good portion of the nearby trail system, and enjoyed spectacular views of waterfalls and boiling mud pits.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest</b>
<br>
<br>
The Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest contains the oldest trees - in fact, according to Wikipedia, the oldest living non-clonal organisms - on the planet. These trees look gnarled with time, like Ian McKellen’s eyebrows, or my grandpa Arndt’s various long-ago-broken fingers. The hikes are beautiful and fun, but it was enormously hot and so we did not go very far due to lack of water. The landscape is also dotted with a number of old mining cabins, which add a touch of history to what would otherwise be mostly a biologically interesting scene.
<br>
<br>
<b>Reno</b>
<br>
<br>
Reno is suffocatingly hot, ugly, and just generally despotic. It is akin to the set of Mad Max - which, remember, was filmed in Namibia - crossed with the “Wrath” part of “The Wrath of Kahn.” Should I ever enlist in the military and have to choose between deployment to Reno or Baghdad, it will prove a difficult choice.
<br>
<br>
<b>Las Vegas</b>
<br>
<br>
There is nothing flashy or cool about Las Vegas. It looks like an abandoned theme park from a former Soviet Bloc country. It looks like the creation of a desperate individual after a year playing Second Life and Minecraft. It looks like the homeless shack next to Hotel Galaxy blew up in a meth lab experiment gone awry. Oh wait, it looks that way because it is that way.

<b>Still Photography Tools</b>
<br>
<br>
While this does not pertain specifically to the video as it was shot entirely using iPhones, I suspect that readers of the video gear portion are interested in still photography gear as well, and so I will start out with an overview of my style of photography gear and the specifics of what gear I use, what I like, and why. If this does not interest you, scroll down to the Video Tools subsection for details on the making of the video at the top of this post.

<br>
I love photography, and generally shoot with my trusty Fujifilm X-Pro1. Fujifiilm builds incredibly high quality, durable, utilitarian cameras for the same sort of people who like Land Rovers: people who enjoy manually controlling everything, who want to have every dial and gear at their fingertips, rather than buried under a bunch of menus and settings in a computer. For this reason, the Fujifilm cameras, particularly the X-series and particularly the X-Pro1 and X-T10, feature an impressive array of fully manual dials allowing the photographer to immediately control every aspect of the captured image. The only other comparable digital cameras in terms of manual controls are the Leica M-Series digital cameras, which cost 2 to 6 times more than the top-of-the-line Fujifilm models, and the Nikon DF. (Note that the Fujifilm X-Pro2 was recently released as a successor to the X-Pro1, and features some small improvements as well as a better sensor. I have no experience with the X-Pro2, but it is most likely an excellent camera.)  The below images illustrate the differences in available manual controls on each of the above listed cameras, and the links direct to the Amazon pages for each product.

I believe that all of these cameras are equally “good”, in that they all take equally beautiful images, and they all have ridiculous specs. My choice of the X-Pro1 ultimately comes down to budget and the desire for a rangefinder, but if you want manual controls on a camera, I think any of the above cameras would be equally good. Do note however that there are a number of Leica M Series cameras, and the Monochrome, pictured above, is really definitely not for everyone. If you are looking for a good all manual camera and want to decide between the above options, I suggest <a href="http://kenrockwell.com">Ken Rockwell</a> and <a href="https://www.dpreview.com">Digital Photography Review</a> as places to find more information. Moreover, the degree of manual usability of a camera is also largely dependent on the lens elected. A good manual lens should have a manual focus ring and a manual aperture ring - as well as a manual zoom ring, if the lens zooms (I do not use zoom lenses, because I value lens speed over zoom versatility, but that really boils down to what you want to shoot and where). A good fully manual lens will look something like this:

I edit in Adobe Lightroom, which I have found to be far more robust than anything I will ever need both on macOS and on iOS, without being confusing or difficult to learn (like Adobe Photoshop is). I am currently in college studying Mathematics and Computer Science, but I work on the side as a photographer for various events and groups on campus, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VWCKJVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VWCKJVA&linkCode=as2&tag=maxvonhip-20&linkId=cb0e03b8e6142c5a527adb644aa2c628">Lightroom</a> makes my job significantly easier.
<br>
<br>
Now let’s get to the video part of the video section of the blog post.
<br>
<br>
<b>Video Tools</b>
<br>
<br>
As a personal challenge, I decided to shoot a video of our road trip entirely on my iPhone. It quickly turned out that I could fill my iPhone’s memory in a single day (due to my large amount of music), and so I had to expand my parameters and use my father’s iPhone, too. I have an iPhone 6 128GB in Silver, and my father has an iPhone 5S 64GB in Silver.
<br>
<br>
The 6S series iPhones have superior cameras to the 6 and especially 5S, but both iPhones shot great video. I did notice that the 5S had trouble focusing through dirty glass (when the window shield needed to be cleaned), whereas the 6 almost always was able to focus on the distance through dirty glass without any issues. This is likely because the 6 has a larger aperture. The rumored new iPhones coming out this September should have far superior cameras to either, but honestly at a certain point it may be just splitting hairs. The video and photo on the 6 series iPhones is always superb, even after years of use, and I really don’t expect anything more than what my iPhone delivers for what is functionally a pocket camera.
<br>
<br>
While the iPhone 6 and 5S both feature impressive wide-angle lenses, sometimes particularly wide roads dominated my shots, and I needed a wider-angle shot. Luckily, I came prepared with a ridiculously high quality ultra-wide-angle lens and lens mount for my iPhone 6. I use the <a href="https://momentlens.co/shop/moment-case-iphone-black/">Moment Lens and Case</a>, and I love its beautiful glass, innocuous black aesthetic, and tactile shutter button. The <a href="https://momentlens.co/momentapp/">app</a> is also superb.
<br>
<br>
The Moment lens allowed me to capture not only wider angle video but also far superior, ultra-wide-angle panoramas, using the native (built-in) iPhone camera app.
<br>
<br>
I often ran out of battery (since I was shooting video almost all day long), and so to combat this I relied on a small collection of battery packs. Of those, my favorite by far was the very cool-looking and functional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V81W0MG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00V81W0MG&linkCode=as2&tag=maxvonhip-20&linkId=d4c5a9ce8fb4c7581d8d0910e6cad120">Boostcase for iPhone 6s and 6</a>.
<br>
<br>
I edited all of my video in iMovie on my Macbook Pro 15" Retina. I would not recommend purchasing this laptop at the moment as a major overhaul to the Macbook Pro product line is rumored to be coming sometime soon this year, and I think it’s worth waiting. That said, I bought my laptop 2 years ago, and it has held up great and is consistently over-powered, beautiful, and usable. The retina display alone is among the greatest developments in laptop innovation of the last 5 years.
<br>
<br>
<b>Video Technique</b>
<br>
<br>
My father once taught me that the trick to capturing images of fish through glass is to hold the camera at an angle subtended between about 30 and 90 degrees to the glass of the fish-tank. Remember, Dad is a fish biologist - he photographs a lot of fish. This trick proved a solid one in capturing the video above. Whenever we reached a particularly attractive portion of road, I fired up my iPhone, put it on Time-Lapse mode in the native (built-in) iOS Camera app, and held my iPhone in Landscape mode such that the top part rested against the inclined glass, and the bottom part rested immediately in front of the air vent on the dashboard.
<br>
<br>
The following image illustrates the angle at which I held the iPhones steady against the glass and dashboard.
<br>
<br>

<br>
(Photo captured with Fujifilm X-Pro1, using XF 27mm f/2.8 black lens)
<br>
<br>
Every day I exported all of my video onto my laptop, copied it from my laptop to a secondary external hard drive, and then deleted it from my iPhone to free up space for the following day. I broke my videos up into 1 to 5 minute portions so that the iOS camera software would not speed them up too much, and frequently checked to make sure the camera was still focussing correctly on the road and landscape (as opposed to the window or its encompassed reflection).
<br>
<br>
I composed and edited the final trip video only upon arrival in Flagstaff.
