<center><i><font color=#6e00ff>“It is the stillest words which bring the storm. Thoughts that come with doves’ footsteps guide the world.”<br>Friedrich Nietzsche</font></i></center>

James Bond can save the world because his reflexes, physical prowess, and training as a runner, skier, gambler, and fighter are beyond compare. In comparison, I cannot catch a football, sprinting gives me asthma, and the only time I ever tried gambling - by buying a single stock of Tesla - I lost $30. My world-saving superpower is predicated on my cognitive, rather than physical, capabilities. I can grapple with complex mathematical concepts, such as topologies, Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, and computation. I can recite verbatim passages and quotes from any of Nietzsche’s works. I can hack most Windows, Linux, and Macintosh computers. Given an hour, I would be hard-pressed to run more than eight miles, but I could easily read a few hundred pages of code documentation.

Friedrich Nietzsche is an inspirational and misunderstood figure. He is typecast as nihilistic, a Nazi, and an atheist. In reality, Nietzsche was anything but nihilistic (he said that human happiness was justification enough for human life), he predated the Nazis but certainly would have despised them given the opportunity, and Thus Spake Zarathustra is a very theistic treatise on the power of the human soul. Nietzsche may have scorned most people, and most religion, but this does not mean he scorned humanity or religiosity.

<br>
Here, Nietzsche espouses the power of word-smithing. The subtlest thoughts, those which creep in “with doves’ footsteps” while you sleep or listen to music or read your morning dose of Ralph Waldo Emerson, often catalyze monumental change. Goethe’s idea of actionable recourse can be summed up in less than ten still, simple words. Newton’s laws are easily articulated in a handful of short equations. But these simple-looking ideas “bring the storm”: they fundamentally alter the course of human thought. I am unlikely to fight a dozen guards and successfully disarm a bomb while flying a helicopter, like James Bond, but Nietzsche reminds me that I can employ my intellect and considerable vocabulary to achieve similarly monumental goals.

My paternal grandparents escaped the Holocaust as toddlers. They waved at Nazi soldiers while their parents covertly snuck them into outbound trains. They escaped because their parents were renowned intellectuals capable of obtaining employment and sponsorship abroad. My grandfather’s father became the chief scientist for the President of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkey, and my grandmother’s parents, psychoanalysts personally trained by Freud, found steady work in the United States providing therapy to the rich and famous. The Nazis took everything they could, but they could not rob my great grandparents of their educations. Even penniless, my great grandparents quickly found success in new countries and languages because of their significant education. In my family, education is everything. Nietzsche espouses the power of education. Verily, the pen is mightier than the sword. For a smart kid with asthma, what could be more inspirational than that?
