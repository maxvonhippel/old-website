The capacity and compulsion to achieve are typically synonymous.  Usain Bolt’s ability to run was not some chance discovery, unlocked by a random attempted-mugging or barely-escaped bear-mauling, just as Einstein did not coincidentally stumble upon his own penchant for physical and mathematical intuition while calculating the tip on his restaurant bill.  Perhaps the greatest catalyst of monumental accomplishment is anxiety, or agitation; the unsettled nature of astronomical talent in a comparatively mundane world produces its own satisfaction.  Socrates spoke of his <i>genius</i>, a divine gremlin in his ear constantly compelling him intellectually onward.  Some subliminal cheetah must lurk between Bolt’s ears, its padded steps an agitation he can only escape through acceleration.

Perhaps the most interesting measure of a society’s values is the manner in which it employs talent.  Talented students on the East Coast are encouraged to pursue careers in finance or politics, while their peers in the West are pushed toward engineering or business.  Talented people are a resource to be used and allocated, just like wheat or barley or corn or steel.  Societies evolve mechanized factories with which to harvest, cultivate, and allocate their respective reservoirs of intellect.  Foxconn assembles, tests, and exports iPhones; Harvard assembles, tests, and exports bankers.

Climate change is the product of bad resource management.  The oil and metals beneath us were broadly allocated for transportation infrastructure, dixie cups, bubble gum, and other conveniences, and as a result the oceans are rising, methane is escaping the ancient Russian tundras, and much of the world may soon be as uninhabitable as Mars (or more so - Mars has recently become <i>en vogue</i> as a proposed alternative to San Francisco).
<br>
<br>
What does the mismanagement of talent look like?  Perhaps Bolt would do more calculable good for the world delivering important messages, or kneading fields of pizza dough with his feet.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective physical exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. […] It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do.  To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.  (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-0.txt">Walden</a>, p.73)

I contend that the most virtuous employment of any ability is that which makes everyone else more able.  Einstein worked hard to unveil the quantifiable behaviors of the time-space-continuum, and now even undergraduate college students can use his discoveries in order to better understand the cosmos.  It is not impressive at all that Thoreau spent years alone in the woods thinking; indeed, most people who have ever lived spent most of their lives in near-solitude in the woods.  But I read <i>Walden</i> in just a few hours, and so gained Thoreau’s wisdom at an approximate rate of 1 Max-hour per 1,752 Thoreau-hours.  Sprinters can learn more by closely watching Bolt’s form as he runs than they ever could through years of experimentation and coaching.  Therefore I conclude that it is better for Bolt to be shown running on the television than for him to be used to deliver messages or knead fields of pizza dough.

This is not to say that academia, poetry, or track and field are more virtuous occupations for talented people than, say, policing, politics, or banking.  In fact, Cicero was a politician, Piketty's expertise is in banking, and Socrates himself was eminently concerned with crime and punishment.  The point is less the occupation of the talented person and more the visibility and consequence of the occupation.  A hypothetical Socrates could be employed as a Department of Motor Vehicles Ticketing Agent, for all I care, so long as his hypothetical Plato is still there to record his maxims and conversations.

The obvious counter to Thoreau’s logic is that talent should be employed for the immediate betterment of the human race, through such as endeavors as curing cancer, or combatting climate change.  This is a strong argument; it is no easy task to argue against curing cancer or combatting climate change.  But are those the sorts of tasks for which super talented people are well-suited?  The universal cure for cancer will probably come from decades of experiments by thousands of trained doctors and scientists on millions of dying patients.  And if we find a solution to climate change which is not contingent on everyone giving up driving, flying, and making babies, that solution will probably result from similarly sized groups of collaborators experimenting on alternative energy sources and pollution sequestration techniques.  The key point here is twofold: first, that really important, global problems tend have solutions which are better addressed by large-scale collaborative experimentation than by any lone-wolf genius, and second, that the individuals involved in solving these problems do not need Einstein levels of brilliance for their work, they need only be smarter than almost everyone else (a comparatively low bar).

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem is, in its original form, just as much mathematics as it is philosophy.  But without it contemporary Number Theory and Computational Complexity Theory probably would not exist.  We might not have Reddit.  The Nazis might have won.

You will probably never accomplish anything of historical consequence.  Only really rare events which change the probability of lots of other events are historically consequential.  For example, Turing’s research lead to the development of digital computers.  It is not every day that someone invents something as useful or popular as the digital computer.  The digital computer easily ranks among the highest cadre of historically consequential inventions, along with the latex condom, the wheel, and the printing press.  But Turing is the exception.  Most of us would do well to acknowledge our likely historical insignificance, and in the wake of this realization, to think about how best to positively influence those rare few who may prove consequential.  Paying Bolt to run in circles is, in my opinion, a sign that we are on the right track.  Sending much of Harvard’s graduating class to make something out of nothing on Wall Street by screwing the rest of us is probably not as great of a decision.  People who can do incredible things will.  The rest of us are morally obligated to identify those people and point them in the right direction.
